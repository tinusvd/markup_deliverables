## Equation

This is one of my favorite equations:

$$
logL = c - \frac{N}{2}log|\Sigma_{\omega}| = \frac{N}{2}tr(S\Sigma^{-1}_{\omega})- \frac{N}{2}(m - \mu{\omega})^T\Sigma^{-1}_{\omega}(m - \mu_{\omega})
$$

-   It is the likelihood function that compares the modeled covariance matrix $\Sigma_{\omega}$ and modeled means $\mu_{\omega}$ to the observed covariance matrix S and observed means m.
-   It is used in structural equation modeling to minimize the distance between the modeled part and the observed part.

## About me...

- My top 5 most streamed albums of 2024 is:
  * BRAT by Charli xcx
  * Charm by Clairo
  * The Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails
  * Bar Mediterraneo by Nu Genea
  * God's Favorite Customer by Father John Misty

- I have a mainline Pok√©mon game of almost every generation (only missing original games of gen 1 and 2)
